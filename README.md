    <h1>Azure Security Management and Compliance Framework</h1>

    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>This project involves creating a comprehensive security management and compliance framework within Azure. Advanced security controls were implemented, continuous monitoring for threats was set up, responses were automated, and compliance with industry standards was ensuredâ€”all key areas covered in the AZ-500 exam. This framework enhances security while streamlining operations and governance in a cloud environment.</p>

    <h2>1. Identity and Access Management (IAM)</h2>
    <h3>Objective:</h3>
    <p>Identities and access permissions in Azure were securely managed to protect sensitive information and prevent unauthorized access.</p>
    <h3>Tasks:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Azure Active Directory (Azure AD):</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Azure AD was set up and configured, integrating it with the existing on-premises Active Directory.</li>
                <li>Multi-factor authentication (MFA) was implemented for all users, requiring at least two verification methods for access.</li>
                <li>Conditional Access policies were configured to control access to resources based on conditions such as user location, device, or risk level.</li>
                <li>Self-Service Password Reset (SSPR) was enabled for users, reducing the burden on IT support while maintaining security.</li>
                <li>Azure AD Identity Protection was integrated to detect and respond to identity-based risks in real-time.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Privileged Identity Management (PIM):</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>PIM was enabled to manage, control, and monitor access to important resources, providing just-in-time (JIT) access for critical roles.</li>
                <li>Approval workflows were implemented for role activations, ensuring that all elevated permissions were appropriately vetted.</li>
                <li>Privileged roles were audited and reviewed periodically to ensure compliance with least privilege principles.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>RBAC roles were assigned to grant the least privilege necessary for users, groups, and service principals, adhering to the principle of least privilege.</li>
                <li>Custom RBAC roles were created, tailored to specific job functions or project needs, ensuring that permissions were precisely aligned with requirements.</li>
                <li>Resource Tags and Management Groups were implemented to organize and secure Azure resources at scale, allowing for more granular access controls.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
